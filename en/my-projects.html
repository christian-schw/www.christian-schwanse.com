                                <li>
                                    What scope should the project have - taking into account that I work and have other
                                    commitments?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Which pages and content should the website contain?
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Who should the website be aimed at and how should it be accessible / findable (e.g.
                                    marketing)?
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                Once the planning was complete, it was time to get down to business - a cycle consisting
                                of the following steps:
                            </p>

                                <li>Testing</li>
                                <li>If successful: Code Refactoring. If failed: Bug Fixing</li>
                                <li>Testing</li>

                            </ol>

                            <p>
                                As a final step, the website was fine-tuned: mobile responsiveness, code refactoring,
                                user-friendliness and SEO.
                            </p>

                                <br>
                                As I have learned about new technologies, my usual approach has changed over time:
                                I plan my projects with the Kanban board function in Github Projects.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Desired changes are created with the help of a self-created Github issue template.
                                Within the template, the Gherkin syntax for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is used.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The issues are sorted by priority. I use the Scrum methodology and define the sprints
                                for what should be done next in the near future. Issues with the highest priority are
                                completed first.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Once it is clear what needs to be done, I use the Jest testing framework to create the
                                tests that need to be fulfilled afterwards (Test-Driven Development, TDD).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After a sprint, I reflect on what could be done better. The next sprint is then planned
                                and implemented.

                                I developed this website without a framework - just the lovely triangle team: HTML, CSS
                                and JavaScript.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Reason: It's my first real, self-programmed website. I'm generally a fan of practicing
                                the basics first before trying out new and interesting things.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I also had the thought that I would clearly see the advantages and compromises of
                                frameworks in the future.

                                    Mobile responsiveness. I thought it would be done with Flexbox and Grid - I was very
                                    wrong. I had to adapt the design in various places so that it looks good on small,
                                    medium-sized and extra-extra-large screens. The testing alone was time-consuming
                                    enough.

                                    It is very <b>time-consuming</b> to develop a website (including content) from
                                    scratch. Figma would be useful in the long term. A tool for designers and developers
                                    to create prototypes of UIs. This avoids the case of programming something for a
                                    long time and then discarding it in the end because you don't like it after all -
                                    I'd rather not say anything about whether this happened to me during the project 😉
                                    Todo management software such as Jira is also helpful.

                                I had a rough idea of what I wanted to do - a website that I would fill with content and
                                then market.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                At the very beginning, I had to acquire knowledge about web development, law and
                                internet marketing. To acquire this knowledge, I read books, blogs and watched videos on
                                YouTube. Topics like:
                            </p>

                                <li>How do I make a website findable on the Internet?</li>
                                <li>How do I get my visitors to browse my website?</li>
                                <li>If something does not work: How do I optimize? How do I test the results or how do I
                                    measure KPIs?</li>
                                <li>What are the legal considerations?</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>
                                The individual pages of the website were implemented as follows:

                                It all started with the requirements analysis. My predecessors had already developed an
                                incomplete offer form. The data came from the same print program as the Bock order
                                confirmation form.

                                Sales used the two forms to define their desired customized offer form. I discussed this
                                step by step with the sales department and recorded it in development documentation. The
                                development can begin.

                                modified slightly. It contained bugs, unsightly as well as dead code. Bug fixing and
                                code refactoring were therefore at the top of my to-do list.

                                I then developed new functionalities. It was a cycle of the following steps:

                                The code was refactored at the end of the project. The development documentation was
                                adapted, formatted and made available to the project participants and the entire SAP
                                team.

                                Before I put a lot of time into the development, I thought it was important to record
                                the requirements together in writing and clearly. This had several advantages such as:
                            </p>

                            <ol>

                                    Facilitates the handover to other developers as well as the mental switching between
                                    several SAP projects
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Due to the clarity, the status of the many changes can be better discussed /
                                    identified (What is finished? What still needs optimization? What is missing?)

                                I also attached great importance to a cycle between implementation and feedback. In
                                order to be able to recognize possible course changes at an early stage and to keep
                                testing easier, as changes are divided into units or blocks.

                                Once the requirements were clear, I initially had no idea how to implement the project.
                                How do I write a report without having to create at least 50 selection screens, database
                                queries and output tables?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                That would be an incredible amount of work. And if new price conditions are added or
                                changed or deleted, maintenance work is required.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When I drew a bird's eye view of the procedure in transaction VOK0 (Customizing pricing)
                                on a sheet of paper, I had the golden idea: dynamic programming.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                So far, I had only dealt with it superficially in the course &ldquor;ABAP for advanced
                                users&ldquo; of the TH Brandenburg (see <a href="about-me.html">About me
                                    page, section Certificates</a> for more information). So I first had to read up
                                extensively and try things out.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                A lot of testing, documentation and code refactoring was carried out during development.
                                Unit tests were also written.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Once the report was finished, the final tests were carried out and the code and
                                documentation were refined. I then presented it.
                            </p>
                        </details>

                            <p>
                                As each price condition has a different access sequence including several accesses, each
                                with a different database table + selection fields, manual, static programming is not
                                possible.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In addition, there is also the requirement to be able to query several condition types
                                at the same time. This in turn makes the program considerably more complex (e.g. only
                                one field called &ldquor;sales organization&ldquo; can be displayed dynamically in the
                                selection screen, although it occurs several times in different databases. In addition,
                                the sales organization must also be entered accordingly in each database table, if
                                available).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                That would be an incredible amount of writing work if the program were written
                                statically. In addition, it would not scale well and would require a lot of maintenance
                                when price conditions change.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                As no one in the company had mastered dynamic programming, I placed a lot of emphasis on
                                documentation and code refactoring. So that my colleagues could adapt the program as
                                quickly and easily as possible - in case I was making a nice life for myself abroad at
                                the time, for example 😉
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Some error handling was carried out in the report. So that users and developers are not
                                left in the dark. With dynamic programming, you also have to understand your craft, as
                                there is no syntax check, for example, and the code is only defined at runtime.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I have also written unit tests so that various tests can be run automatically at the
                                touch of a button. This not only saves a lot of testing effort. It also makes it much
                                easier to expand the program. You can see directly whether the program is still running
                                as intended. This benefits both my colleagues and myself!

                                    Dynamic programming: At the time of the project, nobody in the company was familiar
                                    with the technology. In other words, I was on my own. Through research and trial and
                                    error, I now know a lot more (dynamic selection screen, database query, output
                                    table, ...).
                                </li>

                                    Paper scribbles can be worth their weight in gold. By outlining the entire price

                                    standardization. Advantages include simpler controlling and management of resources.

                            <p>
                                This was my first major SAP project. At the beginning of the rollout, I was an SAP
                                novice. Although I had previously been involved in software development outside of SAP,
                                I was still largely unfamiliar with SAP (both technically and functionally).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Our senior developer had given me a brief introduction to forms development - in general
                                and in relation to the company's previous code base. He had previously only worked with
                                the predecessor form technologies SAPscript and Smart Forms.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In order to understand the latest form technology Adobe Forms and other contexts, I
                                familiarized myself with the topic with the help of the book &ldquor;<a
                                    href="https://www.rheinwerk-verlag.de/sap-interactive-forms-by-adobe-de/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw4f6zBhBVEiwATEHFVvbj5zgwpOKJfT1BrDr8XZ9FLpAnGI_yqP0SUZELtTVqPwoAa5gPdhoCADQQAvD_BwE"

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Other topics such as customizing output types, SAP printer control and functional
                                relationships / processes were taught to me by colleagues in my department.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The planning of developments took place with the respective SAP consultants and
                                departments. My technical questions were clarified by our senior developer, Google or
                                the SAP form book. Once the requirements had been clarified, the development work began.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I documented my developments, tests etc. in detail. The documentation was available to
                                the entire project team. I carried out the tests myself during development and
                                afterwards with the respective departments and SAP consultants.

                            <summary>Why I implemented the project in this way
                            </summary>
                            <p>
                                I documented my developments in detail (both in Word and within the code) in order to
                                simplify and speed up subsequent adjustments on my part or by my colleagues.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I attached great importance to clarity and why comments (e.g. Why was exactly this field
                                used in transaction XYZ and not another?).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I also used object-oriented ABAP. Our previous forms were largely implemented
                                procedurally (FORM routines, function modules, ...).
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Object-oriented programming had great advantages over procedural programming, such as:
                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>More intuitive code, as objects are imitated in the real world</li>
                                <li>
                                    Inheritance, which enables code reuse (e.g. for standardized headers and footers of
                                    forms)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    ABAP OO has a stricter syntax check than procedural ABAP and therefore allows fewer
                                    bugs and nicer, more readable code.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Modularity. What belongs together stays together.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Due to the advantages mentioned above, the software is more scalable overall and
                                    maintenance/extension is more efficient. There are even more reasons why the
                                    software becomes more scalable and maintainable with ABAP OO.
                                </li>
