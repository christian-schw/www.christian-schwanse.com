        <h4>QM Interface: Quipsy - Inspection Plan including Skip-Lot Procedure</h4>
    </header>

    <p class="margin-top-12px margin-bottom-12px">
        Expansion of the interface between SAP and the external QM software Quipsy. This involved
        sending data from SAP to Quipsy (inspection plan including skip-lot procedure). And vice
        versa, data was sent from Quipsy to SAP (Quipsy database changes to the article inspection
        plan assignment).
    </p>

    <details class="details1">
        <summary>General information about the project</summary>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Client:</b> Leading manufacturer in the office chair, lounge furniture and
                automotive industry, > 2,000 employees
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Project Goal:</b> Transfer of the inspection plan including skip-lot procedure in
                SAP incoming goods inspections from SAP to Quipsy to relieve the quality management
                department. Special features: There is no Quipsy test system. Testing must therefore
                be carried out in the productive system. There is also no QM SAP consultant who is
                familiar with the QM module in SAP.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Number of Project Participants:</b> ~ 8 Employees.
            </li>
            <li><b>Time Period:</b> 10/2023 - 12/2023</li>
            <li><b>Industry / Area:</b> Office chair, lounge furniture and automotive industry</li>
            <li>
                <b>Role:</b> Lead Developer (SAP-side).
            </li>
            <li><b>Language:</b> German</li>
            <li>
                <b>Result:</b> Successful transmission of the skip-lot procedure including the
                associated inspection plan. This significantly reduces the workload of the QM
                department. In addition, automatic updating of the article inspection plan
                assignment database table (SAP-side), which minimizes maintenance effort and errors.
                Possible errors are intercepted and written to an error log. As incorrect database
                changes may only be noticed too late, notifications are sent to the relevant
                employees when new entries are made in the error log.

        <summary>How I worked on this project</summary>
        <p>
            The special features of the project that make it much more difficult:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                There is no Quipsy test system. This means that the data exchange between SAP and
                Quipsy had to be tested in the productive system. Attention had to be paid to the
                correctness of the data (purchase order, goods receipt). Also additional
                organizational effort, as several departments including Quipsy consultants are
                involved.
            </li>
            <li>
                No in-house SAP QM consultant available. As it was not completely clear how to
                create and control skip lots or inspection plans in SAP (including the &ldquor;side
                effects&ldquo;), the inspection plans (article inspection plan assignment) had to be
                exported from Quipsy to SAP and kept up to date.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lack of knowledge about the interface. The interface was developed by the SAP
                service provider <a href=“https://de.nttdata.com/” target=“_blank”>NTT DATA</a>.
                Only documentation was available. None of the people responsible at the time were
                still employed. As a result, I had to teach myself everything (contexts, code base,
                ...).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In order to check whether the data (test plan incl. skip lot) was being pulled correctly
            into SAP, it was necessary to run through the entire goods receipt process for each
            test. This means that a purchase order has to be created, an inbound delivery created,
            distributed and maintained in EWM.
        </p>

        <p>
            An external Quipsy consultant was required for Quipsy-side adaptations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Initially, only the skip-lot procedure (skip-lot button in the material master) was to
            be imported from SAP into Quipsy. However, as problems arose, the associated inspection
            plan also had to be imported into Quipsy.
        </p>

        <p>
            As mentioned above, it was not clear how complex or feasible the introduction of
            inspection plans in SAP would be. For this reason, a special SAP database table was
            created for the article inspection plan assignment in SE11. This was initially filled
            via file upload.
        </p>

        <p>
            An SM30 table and associated user documentation were also created so that the Quipsy key
            user can manually update the SAP database table when changes are made. This was
            necessary because the automatic export of the article inspection plan allocation
            database table in Quipsy to SAP had not yet been implemented and development had also
            been delayed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the export of the skip lot including the inspection plan had been successfully
            implemented and tested, the next step was to automatically export the article inspection
            plan assignment database table from Quipsy to SAP in order to be able to determine the
            correct inspection plans in the future. The interface now runs fully automatically.
        </p>

        <p>
            According to Quipsy, it is not possible to export individual database changes. The
            complete database table always had to be transferred to SAP. This Txt file had to be
            prepared in the ABAP code (e.g. remove separators or check whether the material number
            in Quipsy even exists in SAP).
        </p>

        <p>
            To make troubleshooting as easy as possible, an error log with the incorrect database
            changes has also been implemented, which uploads a text file to the SAP directory.
        </p>

        <p>
            To ensure that these errors do not rot away in a dark room, but are rectified
            immediately, a notification is sent to the relevant employees when a new entry is made
            in the error log.
        </p>

        <p>
            Finally, the code was refactored and the existing documentation was updated and made
            available to the in-house SAP and QM departments.
        </p>

    <details class="details1">
        <summary>Why I implemented the project in this way
        </summary>
        <p>
            Much has already been described in the previous section. Perhaps there were better
            solutions. I also had to use the existing code base and interface.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make it easier for the developers after me, I documented the entire incoming goods
            receipt process, which makes testing easier. I also carried out code refactoring and
            always recorded why something had to be implemented exactly the way it was.
        </p>
    </details>


    <details class="details1">
        <summary>My 3 most important points that I have learned from this project</summary>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Goods receipt process: Learned a lot about the functional side. Interrelationships
                became much clearer. Also got to know better how to create and maintain orders and
                deliveries as well as the Quipsy QM software.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is very interesting to see how a leading SAP service provider implements and
                documents an interface.
            </li>
            <li>
                Technically, I also learned a lot: How do I create a database table (SE11 as well as
                SM30)? What is an SAP directory? How do I develop the upload of files (via SAP GUI
                as well as AL11)? How does the Quipsy interface work? How is the Quipsy server
                structured? And so on.
            </li>
        </ol>
