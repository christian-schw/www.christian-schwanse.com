# There's a saying: Never add dependencies to source control!
# Reasons are e. g.:
# Size: Dependencies can significantly increase the size of the repository, 
#       which leads to longer clone and pull times.
# Redundance: If dependencies are managed in a package manager such as npm, pip or yarn, 
#       it is redundant to also store them in the repository.
# Conflicts: Changes to dependencies can cause conflicts if they are managed manually.
# Security: Sensitive information such as API keys or passwords should never be 
#       stored in a public repository.

# Ignore dependencies through npm
/node_modules/

# Ignore Coverage Directory of Jest
# If the “coverage” folder does not exist in the repo: 
# Is created automatically when the Jest tests are executed if not available in the repo.
/coverage/
